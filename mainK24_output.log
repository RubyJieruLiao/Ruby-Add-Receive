of the function tolerance. However, the last step was ineffective.



con2cov: iterations = 35286, max. relative error = 1.234846e-15
Fine stability1 = 213.748106 at x0(EZ) = -1.368000

Equation solved.

fsolve completed because the vector of function values is near zero
as measured by the selected value of the function tolerance, and
the problem appears regular as measured by the gradient.
