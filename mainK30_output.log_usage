-- WARNINGS ----------------------------------------------------------

** Low Walltime utilisation.  While this may be normal, it may help to check the
** following:
**   Did the job parameters specify more walltime than necessary? Requesting
**   lower walltime could help your job to start sooner.
**   Did your analysis complete as expected or did it crash before completing?
**   Did the application run more quickly than it should have? Is this analysis
**   the one you intended to run?
** 
** Low Memory utilisation on hpc022. While this may be normal, it may help to check
** the following:
**   Did the job parameters specify too much memory? Requesting less RAM could
**   help your job to start sooner.
**   Did you use MPI and was the work distributed correctly? Correcting this
**   could allow your job to run using less RAM in each chunk.
**   Did your analysis complete as expected or did it crash before completing?
**   Did the application use less RAM than it should have? Is this analysis the
**   one you intended to run?
