con2cov: iterations = 35316, max. relative error = 1.126095e-15
Fine stability1 = 212.122022 at x0(EZ) = -1.409000

Equation solved.

fsolve completed because the vector of function values is near zero
as measured by the selected value of the function tolerance, and
the problem appears regular as measured by the gradient.
