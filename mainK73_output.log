The vector of function values is near zero, as measured by the selected value
of the function tolerance. However, the last step was ineffective.



con2cov: iterations = 35321, max. relative error = 1.145041e-15
Fine stability1 = 214.215508 at x0(EZ) = -1.399000

Equation solved.

fsolve completed because the vector of function values is near zero
as measured by the selected value of the function tolerance, and
the problem appears regular as measured by the gradient.
